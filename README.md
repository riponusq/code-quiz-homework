# code-quiz-homework

This is the homework of CODE QUIZ using hTML, CSS and  javaScript . I tried to make it what I can.

I have made this homework in the following ways: 

I used Array for question elements. 
when I click the start Button a timer start and I am presented with a question
When I answer a question then I am presented with another question.
when all questions are answeres or the time reaches 0 then the game is over.
I tried to make a score and initials of my score but it didnt come through.
